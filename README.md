# Calculator.github.io
Project Statement:
Challenge is to build out a calculator app and get it looking as close to
the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete
the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to
give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

● See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

● Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division

● Adjust the color theme based on their preference

● Bonus: Have their initial theme preference checked using
prefers-color-scheme and have any additional changes saved in the
browser Download the project and go through the README.md file.

This will provide further details about the project and help you get set
up.
